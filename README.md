# PWA-Budget-Tracker

## Decription

This application is a fast and easy way for Users to track their inflows and outflows of money with an intuitive layout. This application will also display the information with a graph that will track by date and visually display the information. As this application is a PWA, there is a manifest.json file, a service-worker, and indexed database so it can be used offline as well. This application uses MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.js.

## Installation

The installation of this application requires MongoDB, Express.js, npm packages: Mongoose, Morgan, and Compression. To install open the Command Prompt or Terminal on your machine and type "mongod" to initialize the database. Then in your IDE open an Integrated Terminal and type "npm i express; npm i mongoose; npm i morgan; npm i compression;". This will install all the necessary packages. Then in the terminal type "npm start" to spin up the server. Go to your browser of choice and type "localhost:3001" for the URL. The app will then display and you can begin tracking your budget!
